After completing the basic setup, the final step involves configuring the redirection. For example, if your RDP/VPS IP is 24.24.24.24, the redirection URL will be http://24.24.24.24:8080. Ensure that you update this information in both the configuration file and the bot's redirect settings in the Discord Developer Portal.

In the Developer Portal, add the following redirects:
- http://24.24.24.24:8080
- http://24.24.24.24:8080/nig
